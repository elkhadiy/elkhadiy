I'm a Research Engineer currently working on an [electrostatic latching micro-robot prototype](https://phigi.io) and its associated testing apparatus, where I exercice and hone my knowledge in analog and digital electronics design, CAD design, and clean room fabrication techniques. Prior to this, I had the opportunity to work as a Teaching Assistant at UniversitÃ© de Lorraine, where I taught various subjects, including Computer Architecture, Algorithmics, and C programming. I also hold a Ph.D. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Lorraine, where my research focused on Bayesian inference for activities of daily living detection for elderly home care applications.
